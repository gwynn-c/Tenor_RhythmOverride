# Tenor Rhythm Override
A rhythm fps shooter inspired by Hellsinger, Hifi Rush, BPM: Bullets per minute and Robobeat

## The goal of this project:
 - Learning Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) for Procedural Dungeon Generation
 - Using Audio/Song Data and making a interactive environment that feels alive
 - Reactive elements and using a player's intuition to be on beat
 - Creating a Synthwave/Vaporwave aesthetic inspired visuals using Shaders and Custom Rendering

## Current Road Map
- [x] Procedural Dungeon Generator (BSP) - Inspired and learning from [Sunny Valley Studio on YouTube](www.youtube.com/@SunnyValleyStudio)
- [x] Audio Synchronized and a reactive environment
- [x] Conductor class which controls the entire look and feel of the game
- [ ] A custom class and parser which uses Scriptable Objects to allow players to add in custom songs to play with
- [ ] Synthwave shader, visualizer background?
- [ ] Loopable audio (currently only one song length plays with no looping)

### Contributions
